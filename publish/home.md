According to my UI/UX class, usability is key, so if you're here because you're a recruiter and want to know more about me then here is the table of contents:


[[Education]]

[[Full Stack Projects]]

[[Data Science Projects]]

[[Front-end Projects]]

[[Back-end Projects]]

[[Work Experience]]

[[Resume]]

- [[Meme Repository]]
