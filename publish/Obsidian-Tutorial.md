## 5. Can you make the image layout so the pictures are side-by-side?

If you have three pictures such as Picture-1, Picture-2, Picture-3 then you can reference them by
$$
![[\text{Picture-1}]]
![[\text{Picture-2}]]
![[\text{Picture-3}]]
$$
To have it side-by-side, and if you want to make it top to bottom then you can do
$$
![[\text{Picture-1}]]
$$
$$
![[\text{Picture-2}]]
$$
$$
![[\text{Picture-3}]]
$$

Using Cat Images as an example we can show that 
![[Pasted image 20240311105032.png]]![[Pasted image 20240311105033.png]]![[Pasted image 20240311105033 1.png]]
