Here are all of my Data Science Projects I can remember!

[[Meta Marketing Analysis]]
- Context: 
    - $\quad$ As [Professor Wilson's](https://www.biola.edu/directory/people/jason-wilson) Quantitative Consulting Center began to grow with an abundance of students the professor was more inclined to open up the doors to more clients. One of the strategies I proposed to gain more attention to the [Quantitative Consulting Center](https://www.biola.edu/quantitative-consulting-center) was to propose a digital marketing strategy. We sought to deploy a small scale $20 marketing strategy using videos made by the marketing department of Biola and observe the User Interaction to our ads as well as our target demographic.
